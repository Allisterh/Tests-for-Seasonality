# Seasonality Test for Time Series Data: R Package

## Overview

This project is an R package developed to detect seasonality in time series data, based on the advanced methodology proposed by Nwogu, Iwueze & Nlebedim (2016). The package simplifies the application of this comprehensive methodology, making it accessible and efficient for users without requiring specialized mathematical skills.

## Features

- **Time Series Conversion**: Converts raw data into time series objects.
- **Trend Detection**: Automatically identifies trends within the data.
- **User Customization**: Allows customization of parameters such as trend type, series frequency, and significance level.
- **Statistical Tests**: Applies a variety of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests to detect seasonality.

## Validation

The package has been empirically validated using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including stock market indices and global air temperatures. The validation demonstrates high accuracy in detecting seasonality, though some limitations remain, particularly in automatic trend detection and test sensitivities.

## Conclusion

This R package bridges the gap in the practical application of advanced seasonality detection methods, offering a robust and user-friendly tool for analysts and researchers.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following command in R:
```R
# Replace 'github_username' with the actual username
devtools::install_github("github_username/seasonality_test")
```

## Usage

Basic usage examples:
```R
library(seasonalityTest)
# Convert data to time series
ts_data <- convert_to_timeseries(data)
# Detect trend
trend <- identify_trend(ts_data)
# Perform seasonality test
result <- seasonality_test(ts_data, trend=trend)
```
